## AboutMe
I'm Roman, a Beginner Full Stack Web Developer from the United States, currently working freelance. I am an intuitive and hard worker with a lot of attention to detail and I am always eager to learn and improve my skills.

I'm very creative, and when I'm not channeling that creativity into a project I love to play with film cameras, go out hiking, and practice jiu-jitsu.

I am particularly excited about the potential of Web 3.0 and AI to revolutionize the way we interact with the internet. Whether it's through decentralized applications, machine learning, or natural language processing, I can't wait to be a part of the next generation of web development.
